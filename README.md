This website is a side project while trying to migrate off of neocities and to have a small website where all my artsy fartsy stuff can be easily acessed. This is me getting my footing into HTML and CSS again. I really need to figure out how flexbox and other things work now.
Feel free to recommend anything I should improve upon!

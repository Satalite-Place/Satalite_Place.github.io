    <p id="introduction">
        Welcome  to a sick sad satalite place.<br>
        I'm your anxiety ridden digital artist from  the midwest.<br>
        In my ideal world, I would rather be a disk jockey for a local radio station.<br>
        I'm currently in search of work and have plenty of free time.<br>

        Nature is rather amusing and it doesn't take much to satisfy me.<br>
        I have fourteen years of digital art under my belt. I have taken many classes in differnt areas of art.<br>
        I'm also learning how to code the most stupid of things and play guitar.<br>
        I'm learning at my own pace because I can't afford college.
